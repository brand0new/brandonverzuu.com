      <description>By actively taking part within the software development sector I strive to become a motivational speaker. Mainly focussed on:
 creating a process towards consistent understanding of any subject the importance and impact of people on software development projects  I want to be able to have a way of sharing everything I have learned about the topics I encounter, everything I find interesting all the while having my own place to share this from.</description>

      <description>I used to have a personal webpage containing nothing more than the content of the about page. In order to have a place where I can write content of whatever comes to mind I decided to go with my own platform. This minimal approach lets me focus on content rather then get distracted by all the possibilities other platforms out there have to offer.
So what can we expect on here?</description>
