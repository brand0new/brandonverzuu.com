			<description>I used to have a personal webpage containing nothing more than the content of the about page. In order to have a place where I can write content of whatever comes to mind I decided to go with my own platform. This minimal approach lets me focus on content rather then get distracted by all the possibilities other platforms out there have to offer.
So what can we expect on here?</description>

<p>To be honest, I am not sure. I am far from having a strict &ldquo;writing schedule&rdquo; so this means there is no set amount of blog posts I want to write. Subjects will likely be related to technology.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to have a look around on my website!</p>
