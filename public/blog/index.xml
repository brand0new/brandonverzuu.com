      <description>Not long ago I published a new version of my website that no longer used a HTML one-page template. I had written both HTML and CSS files myself and I quickly felt content. The site displayed summarized &amp;ldquo;about me&amp;rdquo; information with some contact details.
Almost immediately after I put the website live, I asked myself: &amp;ldquo;What if I wanted to share content?&amp;quot;. Surely I could use an existing platform to scribble down my thoughts, but could it be possible to put this content on my site without a hassle and without worrying about maintaining components like a Content Management System (CMS) or even the webserver itself?</description>

      <description>I used to have a personal webpage containing nothing more than the content of the about page. In order to have a place where I can write content of whatever comes to mind I decided to go with my own platform. This minimal approach lets me focus on content rather then get distracted by all the possibilities other platforms out there have to offer.
So what can we expect on here?</description>
