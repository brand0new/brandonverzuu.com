The current version of my site has been created with Nuxt!

Previously I've worked with Hugo to generate a static site. But since I've been working Vuetify and experimenting with Nuxt I thought I'd give Nuxt a try for hosting my personal site.

Currently the site is hosted on Cloudflare using their Pages services as a way of hosting static sites. This drastically reduces the complexity of the setup as Cloudflare requires less intermediate steps to host a static site.
