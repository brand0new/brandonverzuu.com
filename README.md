This version of my site has been created with Nuxt!

Previously I've worked with Hugo to generate a statically hosted site on AWS. But since I've been working Vuetify and experimenting with Nuxt I thought I'd give Nuxt a try for hosting my personal site.

Template is blatantly stolen from the Nuxt Content gallery and tweaked to fit my own needs.

All credits go out to (the creator of this template)[https://github.com/fayazara/zooper] 

## Development

Reference `package.json` for all relevant scripts to use during development.

```bash
$ npm run dev 
$ npm run generate

```
