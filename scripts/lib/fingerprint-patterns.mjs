// Pattern tables for scripts/scrub-fingerprint.mjs. Kept separate from the
// script itself so the lists can be extended without touching control flow.
//
// Two tiers:
//   FIXABLE  — safe, meaning-preserving, mechanical. Applied verbatim when
//              the script runs with --fix. Every entry here must be safe to
//              apply blindly, with no chance of mangling a real sentence.
//   FLAGGED  — needs a human or agent to judge in context (deleting the
//              wrong clause could change meaning), so these are reported
//              with line numbers but never auto-edited.
//
// Sources: style-guide.md §9 (Brandon's specific anti-pattern list, the
// primary reference) and the `humanizer` skill's generic AI-writing pattern
// list (used only where it doesn't conflict with something the corpus
// actually does — e.g. the corpus itself uses em dashes and question marks
// heavily, so those are rate-checked against corpus norms, not banned).

// --- FIXABLE: whole-phrase substitutions, meaning-preserving -------------
// [pattern (case-insensitive), replacement]. Replacement '' deletes the
// match; surrounding whitespace/punctuation cleanup happens in the script.
