By actively taking part within the software development sector I strive to become a motivational speaker. Mainly focussed on:

- creating a process towards consistent understanding of any subject
- the importance and impact of people on software development projects

I want to be able to have a way of sharing everything I have learned about the topics I encounter, everything I find interesting all the while having my own place to share this from.

## My way of working

Having a purpose is something I hold dearly. I believe that a lot of people don't see the importance of starting out with truly wanting to understand a subject.

In addition, I believe that everything we enjoy and are successfull in, originates from being able to use this understanding to determine what to do.

This is why I spent my time mastering and understanding the subjects I encounter and see great value in sharing this process and knowledge with others.

## Skill set

Due to the nature of the different projects I encountered, I had to deal with a lot of different tools, programming languages, processes etc. This led to a dispersion of my time and thus also my ability to develop a suffice level of understanding for each of these subjects.

This made me realize that in order to get energy out of my work I would have to focus on one subject at a time so I would give myself the neccesary time to gain a grasp on understanding it.
