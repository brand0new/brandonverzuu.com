Goal of the article:

- Discuss objective ways to figure out what you can do as non-technical person
- How Focus Area Maturity Models can help flush out a general grasp of a domain
- Discuss the viability of characterizing the state of a solution using requirements
- Applying an automation approach by using a large language models for transcript interpretation and cross-referencing Focus Area Maturity Model requirements
- Problems with organisations at scale

Intro

## What's the use of a maturity model?

I've been working within a lot of different organisation each with their own stage of "technological maturity". This basically means that depending on the management, the people, the culture and the technology stack, the organisation is at a different stage of having a solution that is somewhere on the spectrum between rudimentary and advanced.

A common question I get asked usually comes from a management position about "what to do next?". This is very common especially now I'm specializing in integration. Usually there's a certain basic understanding of the different capabilities and practices within a certain domain, but it becomes increasingly difficult to figure out what to do next.

This is where a maturity model comes into play.

### An objective map to the domain

The main premise of a maturity model is to weigh the different capabilities and practices within a certain domain against each other. Whether a practice has been fully implemented is determined using an extensive list of requirements.

These requirements are used to determine the maturity of a certain capability.
