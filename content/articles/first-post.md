I used to have a personal webpage containing nothing more than the content of the about page. In order to have a place where I can write content of whatever comes to mind I decided to go with my own platform. This minimal approach lets me focus on content rather then get distracted by all the possibilities other platforms out there have to offer.

## So what can we expect on here?

To be honest, I am not sure. I am far from having a strict "writing schedule" so this means there is no set amount of blog posts I want to write. Subjects will likely be related to technology.

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to have a look around on my website!
