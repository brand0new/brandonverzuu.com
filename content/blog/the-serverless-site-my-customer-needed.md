Not long ago I published a new version of my website that no longer used a HTML "one-page" template. I had written both HTML and CSS files myself and I quickly felt content. The site displayed really summarized "about me" information with some contact details.

Almost immediately after I put the website live, I asked myself: *"What if I'd wanted to share content?"*. Surely I could use an existing platform to scribble down my thoughts, but could it be possible to put this content om my site without hassling and worrying about maintaining components like a Content Management System (CMS) or a complete server?

So yeah, I meant myself when writing about "my customer" and yes, I think that's disgusting too. But hear me out.

The point is the realisation that I **delivered a product without actually understanding and/or observing what the customer needed.** This is happening around us all the time. Sadly even I contribute to this more then I'd like to commit. So this made me wonder:

> *If I'd be more mindfull about my design process, could I find a solution that actually fulfills my needs?*

## Can I be thoughtfull in design?

**"Design"** is a term broadly used throughout all kinds of industries with nuances to its definition. I could devote a series of posts to the differences in definition and use of the word. For now I'll stick to this definition that spoke to me, in the article "quote":

## The (essential) history of design thinking

trends always come and go
new is not good and old not bad
think about the goal, even if that's today

## Spaces full problems and solutions

3. the lessons: *remove hardships and constraints to support experimentation* --> HUGO is a static site generator written in Go.
